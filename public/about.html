<p>In 2013, I had a pivotal encounter during my first year of secondary school. An intern teacher introduced me to the world of software and its transformative potential. This experience ignited my passion for software development, understanding that it has the power to change lives by generating solutions that benefit individuals and communities. I was captivated by this idea and sought guidance on pursuing a successful career in software engineering. The teacher mentioned the importance of determination, hard work, and collaboration in this field. Coming from a rural village, I was resolute in my desire to change the trajectory of our community.
